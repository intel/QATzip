.SH DESCRIPTION
QATzip is a user space library which builds on top of the Intel QuickAssist
Technology user space library, to provide extended accelerated compression and
decompression services by offloading the actual compression and decompression
request(s) to the Intel Chipset Series. QATzip produces data using the standard
gzip format (RFC1952) with extended headers. The data can be decompressed with a
compliant gzip implementation. QATzip is design to take full advantage of the
performance provided by Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology.
