## Introduction

QATzip is a user space library which builds on top of the Intel&reg; QuickAssist
Technology user space library, to provide extended accelerated compression and
decompression services by offloading the actual compression and decompression
request(s) to the Intel&reg; Chipset Series. QATzip produces data using the standard
gzip\* format (RFC1952) with extended headers or [lz4 blocks][*] with [lz4 frame format][**].
The data can be decompressed with a compliant gzip\* or lz4 implementation. QATzip is
designed to take full advantage of the performance provided by Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology.

## Features

* Acceleration of compression and decompression utilizing Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology,
  including a utility to compress and decompress files.
* Dynamic memory allocation for zero copy, by exposing qzMalloc() and qzFree() allowing
  working buffers to be pinned, contiguous buffers that can be used for DMA operations to
  and from the hardware.
* Instance over-subscription, allowing a number of threads in the same process to
  seamlessly share a smaller number of hardware instances.
* Memory allocation backed by huge page and kernel memory to provide access to pinned,
  contiguous memory. Allocating from huge-page when kernel memory contention.
* Configurable accelerator device sharing among processes.
* Optional software failover for both compression and decompression services. QATzip may
  switch to software if there is insufficient system resources including acceleration
  instances or memory. This feature allows for a common software stack between server
  platforms that have acceleration devices and non-accelerated platforms.
* Automatic recovery from hardware compression failure.
* Provide streaming interface of compression and decompression to achieve better compression
  ratio and throughput for data sets that are submitted piecemeal.
* 'qzip' utility supports compression from regular file, pipeline and block device.
* For standard GZIP format, try hardware decompression 1st before switch to software decompression.
* Enable adaptive polling mechanism to save CPU usage in stress mode.
* 'qzip' utility supports compression files and directories into 7z format.
* For 4xxx(QAT gen 4 devices), QATzip supports lz4 (de)compression algorithm.
* For 4xxx(QAT gen 4 devices), QATzip supports lz4s compression algorithm, the QATzip can generate
  lz4s block with lz4 frame format, which can be used for software post-processing to generate
  other compressed data format.
* For 4xxx(QAT gen 4 devices), QATzip supports ZSTD format compression, through import post-process
  mechanism. this feature request to enable qzstd.

## Software Requirements

This release was validated on the following:

* QATzip has been tested with the latest Intel&reg; QuickAssist Acceleration Driver.
  Please download the QAT driver from the link https://developer.intel.com/quickassist
* QATzip has been tested by Intel&reg; on CentOS 7.8.2003 with kernel 3.10.0-1127.19.1.el7.x86\_64
* Zlib\* library of version 1.2.7 or higher
* Suggest GCC\* of version 4.8.5 or higher
* lz4\* library
* zstd\* static library

## Additional Information

The compression level in QATzip could be mapped to standard zlib\* as below:
* QATzip level 1 - 4, similar to zlib\* level 1 - 4.
* QATzip level 5 - 8, we map them to QATzip level 4.
* QATzip level 9, we will use software zlib\* to compress as level 9.

## Limitations

* The partitioned internal chunk size of 16 KB is disabled, this chunk is used for QAT hardware DMA.
* For stream object, user should reset the stream object by calling qzEndStream() before reuse it
  in the other session.
* For stream object, user should clear stream object by calling qzEndStream() before clear session
  object with qzTeardownSession(). Otherwise, memory leak happens.
* For stream object, stream length must be smaller than `strm_buff_sz`, or QATzip would generate multiple
  deflate block in order and has the last block with BFIN set.
* For stream object, we will optimize the performance of the pre-allocation process using a thread-local
  stream buffer list in a future release.
* For 7z format, decompression only supports \*.7z archives compressed by qzip.
* For 7z format, decompression only supports software.
* For 7z format, the header compression is not supported.
* For lz4(s) compression, QATzip only supports 32KB history buffer.
* For zstd format compression, qzstd only supprots `hw_buffer_sz` which is less than 128KB.
* Stream APIs only support "DEFLATE_GZIP", "DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT", "DEFLATE_RAW" for compression
  and "DEFLATE_GZIP", "DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT" for decompression now.
* For compression(not stream), QATZip HW only support data format including "DEFLATE_4B", "DEFLATE_GZIP",
  "DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT", "DEFLATE_RAW", "LZ4". Otherwise it will fallback to sw.
* For decompression(not stream), QATZip HW only support data format including "DEFLATE_GZIP", "DEFLATE_4B",
  "DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT", "LZ4". Otherwise it will fallback to sw.

### Install QATzip As Root User

**Set below environment variable**

`ICP_ROOT`: the root directory of your QAT driver source tree

`QZ_ROOT`: the root directory of your QATzip source tree

**Enable huge page**

```bash
    echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
    rmmod usdm_drv
    insmod $ICP_ROOT/build/usdm_drv.ko max_huge_pages=1024 max_huge_pages_per_process=48
```

**Compile and install QATzip**

```bash
    cd $QZ_ROOT
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-ICP_ROOT=$ICP_ROOT
    make clean
    make all install
```

For more configure options, please run "./configure -h" for help

**Update configuration files**

___Have to update those file, Otherwise QATzip will be Unavailable.___

QAT's the programmerâ€™s guide which provides information on the architecture of the software
and usage guidelines. it allows customization of runtime operation.

* [Intel&reg; linux Programmer's Guide][4]

[4]:https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/710060/intel-quickassist-technology-software-for-linux-programmer-s-guide-hw-version-1-7.html

The Intel&reg; QATzip comes with some tuning example conf files to use. you can replace the
old conf file(under /etc/) by them. The detailed info about Configurable options, please
refer Programmer's Guide mannual.

The process section name(in configuration file) is the key change for QATzip.
there are two way to change:
* QAT Driver default conf file does not contain a [SHIM] section which the Intel&reg; QATzip
  requires by default. you can follow below step to replace them.
* The default section name in the QATzip can be modified if required by setting the environment
variable "QAT_SECTION_NAME".

To update the configuration file, copy the configure file(s) from directory of
`$QZ_ROOT/config_file/$YOUR_PLATFORM/$CONFIG_TYPE/*.conf`
to directory of `/etc`

`YOUR_PLATFORM`: the QAT hardware platform, c6xx for Intel&reg; C62X Series
Chipset, dh895xcc for Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series

`CONFIG_TYPE`: tuned configure file(s) for different usage,
`multiple_process_opt` for multiple process optimization,
`multiple_thread_opt` for multiple thread optimization

**Restart QAT driver**

```bash
    service qat_service restart
```

With current configuration, each PCI-e device in C6XX platform could support
32 processes in maximum.

### Install QATzip As Non-root User

**Add Non-root user to qat group**

The installation of QAT driver package configures the driver to allow applications
to run as Non-root user. The users must be added to the 'qat' group after QAT drvier
is installed.

```bash
    sudo usermod -g qat username # need to relogin
    or
    sudo newgrp qat  # effective immediately
```

Change the amount of max locked memory for the username that is included in the group
name. This can be done by specifying the limit in /etc/security/limits.conf.
To set 500MB add a line like this in /etc/security/limits.conf:
```bash
   cat /etc/security/limits.conf |grep qat
   @qat - memlock 500000
```

**Enable huge page as root user**

```bash
    echo 1024 > /sys/kernel/mm/hugepages/hugepages-2048kB/nr_hugepages
    rmmod usdm_drv
    insmod $ICP_ROOT/build/usdm_drv.ko max_huge_pages=1024 max_huge_pages_per_process=48
```

**Update the configuration files as root user**

To update the configuration file, copy the configure file(s) from directory of
`$QZ_ROOT/config_file/$YOUR_PLATFORM/$CONFIG_TYPE/*.conf`
to directory of `/etc`

`YOUR_PLATFORM`: the QAT hardware platform, c6xx for Intel&reg; C62X Series
Chipset, dh895xcc for Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series

`CONFIG_TYPE`: tuned configure file(s) for different usage,
`multiple_process_opt` for multiple process optimization,
`multiple_thread_opt` for multiple thread optimization

**Restart the QAT driver as root user**

```bash
    service qat_service restart
```

With current configuration, each PCI-e device in C6XX platform could support
32 processes in maximum

**Set below environment variable as non-root user**

`ICP_ROOT`: the root directory of your QAT driver source tree

`QZ_ROOT`: the root directory of your QATzip source tree

**Compile and install QATzip as root user**

```bash
    cd $QZ_ROOT
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --with-ICP_ROOT=$ICP_ROOT
    make clean
    make all
    make install
```

For more configure options, please run "./configure -h" for help

### Enable qzstd
If you want to enable lz4s + postprocessing pipeline, you have to compile qzstd. which
is a sample app to support ZSTD format compression/decompression. before enabling qzstd,
make sure that you have installed zstd static lib.

**Compile qzstd**

```bash
    cd $QZ_ROOT
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --enable-lz4s-postprocessing
    make clean
    make qzstd
```
**test qzstd**

```bash
    qzstd -h

    it could support below options:
    "Compress or uncompress a file with zstandard format.",
    "",
    "  -d,       decompress",
    "  -h,       show help information",
    "  -L,       set compression level of QAT",
    "  -o,       set output file name",
    "  -C,       set chunk size",
    "  -r,       set max inflight request number",
    "  -P,       set polling mode, only supports busy polling settings",
```

### Test QATzip

Run the following command to check if the QATzip is setup correctly for
compressing or decompressing files:

```bash
    qzip -k $your_input_file (add -h for help)
    or
    cat $your_input_file | qzip > $yout_output_file

    This compression and decompression util could support below options:
    "  -A, --algorithm   set algorithm type, currently only support deflate",
    "  -d, --decompress  decompress",
    "  -f, --force       force overwrite of output file and compress links",
    "  -h, --help        give this help",
    "  -H, --huffmanhdr  set huffman header type",
    "  -k, --keep        keep (don't delete) input files",
    "  -V, --version     display version number",
    "  -L, --level       set compression level",
    "  -C, --chunksz     set chunk size",
    "  -O, --output      set output header format(gzip|gzipext|7z)",
    "  -r,               set max inflight request number",
    "  -R,               set Recursive mode for decompressing a directory
                         It only supports for gzip/gzipext format and
                         decompression operation",
    "  -o,               set output file name",
    "  -P, --polling     set polling mode, only supports busy polling settings"
```

#### File compession in 7z:
```bash
    qzip -O 7z FILE1 FILE2 FILE3... -o result.7z
```
#### Dir compression in 7z:
```bash
    qzip -O 7z DIR1 DIR2 DIR3... -o result.7z
```
#### Decompression file in 7z:
```bash
    qzip -d result.7z
```
#### Dir Decompression with -R:
If the DIR contains files that are compressed by qzip and using gzip/gzipext
format, then it should be add `-R` option to decompress them:
```bash
    qzip -d -R DIR
```

### Performance Test With QATzip

Please run the QATzip (de)compression performance test with the following command.
Please update the drive configuration and process/thread argument in run_perf_test.sh
before running the performance test.
Note that when number for threads changed, the argument "max_huge_pages_per_process"
in run_perf_test.sh should be changed accordingly, at least 6 times of threads number.

```bash
    cd $QZ_ROOT/test/performance_tests
    ./run_perf_test.sh
```
