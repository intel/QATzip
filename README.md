## Introduction

QATzip is a user space library which builds on top of the Intel&reg; QuickAssist
Technology user space library, to provide extended accelerated compression and
decompression services by offloading the actual compression and decompression
request(s) to the Intel&reg; Chipset Series. QATzip produces data using the standard
gzip\* format (RFC1952) with extended headers or [lz4\* blocks][7] with [lz4\* frame format][8].
The data can be decompressed with a compliant gzip\* or lz4\* implementation. QATzip is
designed to take full advantage of the performance provided by Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology.

The currently supported formats include:

|Data Format|Algorithm|QAT device|Description|
| :---------------:     |  :---------------: |:---------------: | :------------------------------------------------------------: |
| `QZ_DEFLATE_4B`       | deflate\*            | QAT 1.x and QAT 2.0|Data is in DEFLATE\* with a 4 byte header|
| `QZ_DEFLATE_GZIP`     | deflate\*            | QAT 1.x and QAT 2.0|Data is in DEFLATE\* wrapped by Gzip\* header and footer|
| `QZ_DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT` | deflate\*            | QAT 1.x and QAT 2.0|Data is in DEFLATE\* wrapped by Intel&reg; QAT Gzip\* extension header and footer|
| `QZ_DEFLATE_RAW`      | deflate\*            | QAT 1.x and QAT 2.0|Data is in raw DEFLATE\* without any additional header. (Only support compression, decompression will fallback to software) |
| `QZ_LZ4`              | lz4\*                | QAT 2.0|Data is in LZ4\*  wrapped by lz4\* frame |
| `QZ_LZ4S`             | lz4s\*               | QAT 2.0|Data is in LZ4S\* blocks |

## Features

* Acceleration of compression and decompression utilizing Intel&reg; QuickAssist Technology,
  including a utility to compress and decompress files.
* Dynamic memory allocation for zero copy, by exposing qzMalloc() and qzFree() allowing
  working buffers to be pinned, contiguous buffers that can be used for DMA operations to
  and from the hardware.
* Instance over-subscription, allowing a number of threads in the same process to
  seamlessly share a smaller number of hardware instances.
* Memory allocation backed by huge page and kernel memory to provide access to pinned,
  contiguous memory. Allocating from huge-page when kernel memory contention.
* Configurable accelerator device sharing among processes.
* Optional software failover for both compression and decompression services. QATzip may
  switch to software if there is insufficient system resources including acceleration
  instances or memory. This feature allows for a common software stack between server
  platforms that have acceleration devices and non-accelerated platforms.
* Provide streaming interface of compression and decompression to achieve better compression
  ratio and throughput for data sets that are submitted piecemeal.
* 'qzip' utility supports compression from regular file, pipeline and block device.
* For QATzip GZIP\* format, try hardware decompression first before switching to software decompression.
* Enable adaptive polling mechanism to save CPU usage in stress mode.
* 'qzip' utility supports compression files and directories into 7z format.
* Support QATzip Gzip\* format, it includes 10 bytes header and 8 bytes footer:

  `| ID1 (1B) | ID2(0x8B) (1B) | Compression Method (8 = DEFLATE*) (1B) | Flags (1B) | Modification Time (4B) | Extra Flags (1B) | OS (1B) | Deflate Block| CRC32(4B)| ISIZE(4B)|`
* Support QATzip Gzip\* extended format. This consists of the standard 10 byte Gzip* header and follows RFC 1952 to extend the header by an additional 14 bytes. The extended headers structure is below:

  `| Length of ext. header (2B) | SI1('Q') (1B) | SI2('Z') (1B) | Length of subheader (2B) | Intel(R) defined field 'Chunksize' (4B) | Intel(R) defined field 'Blocksize' (4B) | `
* Support Intel&reg; QATzip 4 byte header, the header indicates the length of the compressed block followed by the header.

  `| Intel(R) defined Header (4B)|deflate\* block|`
* Support QATzip lz4* format. This format is structured as follows:

  `| MagicNb(4B) |FLG(1B)|BD(1B)| CS(8B)|HC(1B)| |lz4\* Block | EndMark(4B)|`

## Limitations

* The partitioned internal chunk size of 16 KB is disabled, this chunk is used for QAT hardware DMA.
* For stream object, user should reset the stream object by calling qzEndStream() before reuse it
  in the other session.
* For stream object, user should clear stream object by calling qzEndStream() before clear session
  object with qzTeardownSession(). Otherwise, memory leak happens.
* For stream object, stream length must be smaller than `strm_buff_sz`, or QATzip would generate multiple
  deflate block in order and has the last block with BFIN set.
* For stream object, we will optimize the performance of the pre-allocation process using a thread-local
  stream buffer list in a future release.
* For 7z format, decompression only supports \*.7z archives compressed by qzip.
* For 7z format, decompression only supports software.
* For 7z format, the header compression is not supported.
* For lz4\* (de)compression, QATzip only supports 32KB history buffer.
* For zstd format compression, qzstd only supports `hw_buffer_sz` which is less than 128KB.
* Stream APIs only support "DEFLATE_GZIP", "DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT", "DEFLATE_RAW" for compression
  and "DEFLATE_GZIP", "DEFLATE_GZIP_EXT" for decompression now.
* DEFLATE_RAW hardware decompression is supported and input data must be complete deflate block. If input data is not complete block and software backup is enabled decompression will fallback on software else failure will be returned.

## Installation Instructions

### Install with the in-tree QAT package

* Please refer to [link][11].

### Install with the out-of-tree QAT package

1. The Installation of the out-of-tree QAT package refer to [link][12].
> **Note**<br>
> - If you run QAT as **non-root** user, more steps need to be manually applied, please refer to [link][13].<br>
> - If SVM is not enabled, memory passed to QAT hardware must be DMAâ€™able, Intel provides a USDM component
> which allocates/frees DMA-able memory. Please refer to [link][14] for USDM setting.

2. Install the package dependencies by running the below command:
```
sudo dnf install -y autoconf automake libtool zlib-devel lz4-devel
For Debian-based distros like Ubuntu, use these names for the latter two packages:
sudo apt -y install zlib1g-dev liblz4-dev
```

3. Configure the QATzip library by running the following commands:
```
cd QATzip/
export QZ_ROOT=`pwd`
export ICP_ROOT=/QAT/PACKAGE/PATH
./autogen.sh
./configure
```
> **Note**<br>
> For more configure options, please run "./configure -h" for help.

4. Build and install the QATzip library by running the below commands:
```
make clean
make
sudo make install
```

### Configuration

> **Note**<br>
> This section is only required when you are using out-of-tree QAT package. if you are
> using qatlib with in-tree QAT package, please refer to [link][16] for details on configuring qatlib.

QAT programmerâ€™s guide which provides information on the architecture of the software
and usage guidelines, allows customization of runtime operation.

* [Intel&reg; QAT 1.7 linux Programmer's Guide][9]
* [Intel&reg; QAT 2.0 linux Programmer's Guide][10]

The Intel&reg; QATzip comes with some tuning example conf files to use. you can replace the
old conf file(under /etc/) by them. The detailed info about Configurable options, please
refer Programmer's Guide manual.

The process section name(in configuration file) is the key change for QATzip.
There are two way to change:
* QAT Driver default conf file does not contain a [SHIM] section which the Intel&reg; QATzip
  requires by default. You can follow below step to replace them.
* The default section name in the QATzip can be modified if required by setting the environment
variable "QAT_SECTION_NAME".

To update the configuration file, copy the configure file(s) from the directory of
`$QZ_ROOT/config_file/$YOUR_PLATFORM/$CONFIG_TYPE/*.conf`
to the directory of `/etc`

`YOUR_PLATFORM`: the QAT hardware platform, c6xx for Intel&reg; C62X Series
Chipset, dh895xcc for Intel&reg; Communications Chipset 8925 to 8955 Series

`CONFIG_TYPE`: tuned configure file(s) for different usage,
`multiple_process_opt` for multiple process optimization,
`multiple_thread_opt` for multiple thread optimization.

**Restart QAT driver**

```bash
    service qat_service restart
```

With current configuration, each PCI-e device in C6XX platform could support
32 processes in maximum.

### Enable qzstd
If you want to enable lz4s + postprocessing pipeline, you have to compile qzstd which
is a sample app to support ZSTD format compression/decompression. Before enabling qzstd,
make sure that you have installed zstd static lib.

**Compile qzstd**

```bash
    cd $QZ_ROOT
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --enable-lz4s-postprocessing
    make clean
    make qzstd
```
**test qzstd**

```bash
    qzstd $your_input_file
```
### Build Docker Image
Also there is dockerfile available for QAT Compression Base which can be built
into docker images.
Please refer [here](dockerfiles/README.md) for more details.

## Test QATzip

Run the following command to check if the QATzip is setup correctly for
compressing or decompressing files:

```bash
    qzip -k $your_input_file  -O gzipext -A deflate
```

### File compression in 7z:
```bash
    qzip -O 7z FILE1 FILE2 FILE3... -o result.7z
```
### Dir compression in 7z:
```bash
    qzip -O 7z DIR1 DIR2 DIR3... -o result.7z
```
### Decompression file in 7z:
```bash
    qzip -d result.7z
```
### Dir Decompression with -R:
If the DIR contains files that are compressed by qzip and using gzip/gzipext
format, then it should be add `-R` option to decompress them:
```bash
    qzip -d -R DIR
```

## Performance Test With QATzip

Please run the QATzip (de)compression performance test with the following command.
Please update the drive configuration and process/thread argument in run_perf_test.sh
before running the performance test.
Note that when number for threads changed, the argument "max_huge_pages_per_process"
in run_perf_test.sh should be changed accordingly, at least 6 times of threads number.

```bash
    cd $QZ_ROOT/test/performance_tests
    ./run_perf_test.sh
```

## QATzip API Manual

Please refer to file `QATzip-man.pdf` under the `docs` folder
Please refer to the [link][15] for QAT documents

## Open Issues
Known issues relating to the QATzip are described in this section.

### QATAPP-26069
| Title      |     Buffers allocated with qzMalloc() can't be freed after calling qzMemDestory    |
|----------|:-------------
| Reference   | QATAPP-26069 |
| Description | If the users call qzFree after qzMemDestory, they may encounter free memory error "free(): invalid pointe" |
| Implication | User use qzMalloc API to allocate continuous memory |
| Resolution | Ensure qzMemDestory is invoked after qzFree, now we use attribute destructor to invoke qzMemDestory|
| Affected OS | Linux |

### QATAPP-33809
| Title      |     Failures using standalone mode in multi-threaded application    |
|----------|:-------------
| Reference   | QATAPP-33809 |
| Description | If a multi-threaded application using standalone mode (no qatmgr) calls icp_sal_userStart() in one thread and icp_sal_userStop() in a different thread, errors like "Incorrect thread xxx for section SSL_INT_X. Expected yyy" will be seen.Â Â |
| Implication | Standalone mode is typically used when running in a container and this error has been seen there. If icp_sal_userStop() is called in a separate thread, after this error is seen some resources, e.g. memory, will not be freed. As long as the process finishes after calling icp_sal_userStop(), the resources will be freed by the OS. However, if the process doesn't end and icp_sal_userStart() is called again, the behaviour will be undefined.|
| Resolution | If running in standalone mode in a multi-threaded process, it's recommended to call icp_sal_userStart() and icp_sal_userStop() in the same thread to avoid seeing these errors.|
| Affected OS | Linux |
| Driver/Module | CPM-IA - General |
